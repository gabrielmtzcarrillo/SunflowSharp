# SunflowSharp

**SunflowSharp** is a C# port of the original [Sunflow](https://sunflow.sourceforge.net/) renderer.  

This project aims to modernize Sunflowâ€™s CPU-based ray tracing engine in C# for experimentation, learning, and long-term development.

## Status

This repository is currently under **long-term maintenance**. While active development may be gradual, contributions and suggestions are welcome.

### Important Notes
- The original project was previously hosted via SVN and is now fully migrated to GitHub.
- Any legacy SVN references or metadata have been removed as of this migration.

## Goals

- Provide a clean and modern C# implementation of a ray tracing engine.
- Serve as a base for further research in rendering techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gabrielmtzcarrillo/SunflowSharp.git
   ```

2. Open in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.

3. Build and run the renderer (console-based interface, scene loading from file system).
